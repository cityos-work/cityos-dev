# Building Digital City Spaces

&nbsp;


{: .highlight }
**CityOS** is a framework that enables **urban communities and organizations** to build **digital spaces** for their **social interactions** and **digital assets**.

It implements concepts and ideas elaborated by the [**Digital City Institute**](https://digital.city.institute){:target=_blank} and represents the technology base for the [**IM.CITY**](https://IM.CITY){:target=_blank} and [**UR.CITY**](https://UR.CITY){:target=_blank} platforms.

CityOS features a **digital rewards framework** that uses tokens to reward community members for their presence, participation, and interactions.

The attendees and visitors are able to **check in** to the digital spaces and **interact** with various entities or with other attendees.

## The Reasons

----------------

With the development of new technologies (IoT, AI, Blockchain, DLT, etc.), our **social interactions** become more complex and more and more **digital**. 
So, we need to evolve from **"social media"** to **"social spaces"** and from "social networks" to "social ecosystems".

{: .highlight }
**CityOS** enables the transition from **"social media"** to **"social spaces"**.

## The Components

----------------

Our **social spaces are increasingly digital**, and they do not necessarily have to resemble physical spaces in appearance.        
We call them **Digital City Spaces**.

The main component of a digital space is **the Venue**, where the attendees conduct their social interactions within the participatory and collaborative systems of the CityOS.    

Additionally, each digital space can have an **Info Desk**, an **Orders Desk**, and a **News Desk**.

The interactions within the Digital Space are **rewarded** with **digital tokens**.

The attendees can also interact with **Intelligent Agents** that are able to provide information, services, and products to the attendees, and they can be rewarded for their positive impact on the community.


## The Utility

----------------

#### Some examples on how **Digital Spaces** can be used:

- **Administrative Spaces** (e.g. City Halls, Town Halls, etc.)
- **Public Spaces** (e.g. Parks, Squares, etc.)
- **Private Spaces** (e.g. Offices, Shops, Guest House, Cafe, etc.)
- **Custom Spaces** (e.g. Customized Venues, etc.)



#### Some examples on how **Venues** can be used:

- **Events** (e.g. Conferences, Meetups, Workshops, etc.)
- **Project collaboration** (e.g. Meetings, Workplace, etc.)
- **Social Interactions** (e.g. Parties, Gatherings, etc.)

## `digital city` vs `virtual city`

------------------

#### Digital City

The **Digital City** term describe the digital infrastructure that underlies and supports the interactions and activities taking place in urban environments.

#### Virtual City

The **Virtual City** is a simulated ecosystem created in a virtual environment, often for entertainment or educational purposes.
