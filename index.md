## What is CityOS?

----------------

The **CityOS** provide the proper tools    
for any type of community   
to build their own **participatory & rewarding framework**    
by creating a _digital/virtual city_ ecosystem    
for their social interactions and their digital assets.

A _digital/virtual city_ can be created from scratch or by connecting to an existing city.  
In the case of connecting to an existing city, the _digital city_ can have the same geographical boundaries as the existing city, or it can be open to the whole world.

CityOS is a **token-based** framework, that allows the community to **reward their community members** for their participation.

It is a modular system that can be used to build a new digital platform or to extend an existing one.

A digital city can address any kind of community, from a small group of friends to a large city and its citizens.

## What is the difference between a digital city and a virtual city

------------------

### Digital City

Digital cities are detailed digital representations of real-world social interactions created to increase community participation.

### Virtual City

Virtual cities are simulated cities created in a virtual environment, often for entertainment or educational purposes.
