## What is CityOS?

The **CityOS** provide proper tools    
for any type of community   
to build their own **participatory & rewarding framework**    
by creating a _digital city_ ecosystem    
for their social interactions and their digital assets.

A _digital city_ can be created from scratch or by connecting to a physically existing city.  
In the case of connecting to an existing city, the _digital city_ can have the same geographical boundaries as the existing city, or it can be open to the whole world.

CityOS is a **token-based** framework, that allows the community to **reward their community members** for their contributions.

It is a modular system that can be used to build a new digital platform or to extend an existing one.

A digital city can address any kind of community, from a small group of friends to a large city and its citizens.

There are 2 layers in the CityOS framework: 
- the **virtual city** layer and
- the **smart city** layer.
