## What is CityOS?

The **CityOS** is an operating system for any type of community providing proper tools to build their own **participatory & rewarding framework** by creating a _digital city_ ecosystem for their social interactions and their digital assets.

A _digital city_ can be created from scratch or by connecting to a physically existing city.  
In the case of connecting to an existing city, the _digital city_ can have the same geographical boundaries as the existing city, or it can be open to the whole world.

CityOS is a **token-based** framework, that allows the community to **reward their community members** for their contributions.

It is a modular system that can be used to build a new digital platform or to extend an existing one.
