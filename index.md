# Building Digital City Spaces

&nbsp;


Welcome to CityOS, an operating system for digital city states â€“ a new form of independent cities. With CityOS, anyone will be able to create and manage their own digital city and manage their community.

To get started, we recommend visiting IM.CITY, the Proof of Concept project for a digital city (under development). Our online platform provides communities and organizations with a complete set of tools for conducting collective decision-making processes, including research, dialogue, debate, and voting. This module is called the Decision-Making Engine (DME).

Users can provide data and ideas as part of the decision-making process, and have the option to use Intelligent Agents (AI tools) to provide them with information or suggestions. These Intelligent Agents are powered by the OpenAI API, and can be accessed by spending a digital token called the Digital Intelligence Token ($DIT). Users can earn $DIT tokens through a Universal Basic Income (UBI) for Intelligent Agents, or purchase them from the platform or from other users.

In addition to the DME, our platform also includes a Digital Rewards Engine (DRE) for managing different types of digital rewards for users, including UBI and other mechanisms. The Digital City Token ($DCT) is the main token of the platform, and can be used to access features and services on the platform. Users can earn $DCT through a Universal Basic Income (UBI) or other rewards, purchase them, or transfer them to/from other users.

IM.CITY also includes Digital Spaces where users can check in and participate. These Digital Spaces can be owned by individuals or organizations, and provide a place for communities to come together and collaborate. Users can create their own Digital Spaces or join existing ones, and can customize the privacy and accessibility settings to suit their needs. Within a Digital Space, users can use the tools provided by the DME to conduct collective decision-making processes, and can earn or spend Digital Intelligence Tokens ($DIT) and Digital City Tokens ($DCT) as part of the process. Digital Space Tokens ($DST) are used to determine the capacity of a Digital Space.

We believe that CityOS and IM.CITY have the potential to revolutionize the way communities and organizations make decisions, and we invite you to join us on this journey as we build a better future together. Our project is still in the early stages, but we are excited about the potential it holds and we hope you will join us in shaping the future of digital city states.

**CityOS** is a framework that enables **urban communities and organizations** to build **digital spaces** for their **social interactions** and **digital assets**.

It implements concepts and ideas elaborated by the [**Digital City Institute**](https://digital.city.institute){:target=_blank} and represents the technology base for the [**IM.CITY**](https://IM.CITY){:target=_blank} and [**UR.CITY**](https://UR.CITY){:target=_blank} platforms.

CityOS features a **digital rewards framework** that uses tokens to reward community members for their presence, participation, and interactions.

The attendees and visitors are able to **check in** to the digital spaces and **interact** with various entities or with other attendees.

## The Reasons

----------------

With the development of new technologies (IoT, AI, Blockchain, DLT, etc.), our **social interactions** become more complex and more and more **digital**. 
So, we need to evolve from **"social media"** to **"social spaces"** and from "social networks" to "social ecosystems".

{: .highlight }
**CityOS** enables the transition from **"social media"** to **"social spaces"**.

## The Components

----------------

As our **social spaces are increasingly digital**, it's only natural to call them **Digital City Spaces**, and they do not necessarily have to resemble physical spaces in appearance.        

The main component of a digital space is **the Venue**, where the attendees conduct their social interactions within the participatory and collaborative systems of the CityOS.    

Additionally, each digital space can have an **Info Desk**, an **Orders Desk**, and a **News Desk**.

Various interactions within the Digital Space can be **rewarded** with **digital tokens** for their positive impact on the community.

The attendees can also interact with **Intelligent Agents** that are able to provide information, services, and products to the attendees.


## The Utility

----------------

#### Some examples on how **Digital Spaces** can be used:

- **Administrative Spaces** (e.g. City Halls, Town Halls, etc.)
- **Public Spaces** (e.g. Parks, Squares, etc.)
- **Private Spaces** (e.g. Offices, Shops, Guest House, Cafe, etc.)
- **Custom Spaces** (e.g. Customized Venues, etc.)



#### Some examples on how **Venues** can be used:

- **Events** (e.g. Conferences, Meetups, Workshops, etc.)
- **Project collaboration** (e.g. Meetings, Workplace, etc.)
- **Social Interactions** (e.g. Parties, Gatherings, etc.)

## `digital city` vs `virtual city`

------------------

#### Digital City

The **Digital City** term describe the digital infrastructure that underlies and supports the interactions and activities taking place in urban environments.

#### Virtual City

The **Virtual City** is a simulated ecosystem created in a virtual environment, often for entertainment or educational purposes.
