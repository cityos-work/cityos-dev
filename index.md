# Building the Operating System for Digital City Spaces

&nbsp;


Welcome to CityOS, an operating system for digital city states – a new form of independent cities. With CityOS, anyone will be able to create and manage their own digital city and manage their community.

To get started, we recommend visiting IM.CITY, the Proof of Concept project for a digital city (under development). Our online platform provides communities and organizations with a complete set of tools for conducting collective decision-making processes, including research, dialogue, debate, and voting. This module is called the Decision-Making Engine (DME).

Users can provide data and ideas as part of the decision-making process, and have the option to use Intelligent Agents (AI tools) to provide them with information or suggestions. These Intelligent Agents are powered by the OpenAI API, and can be accessed by spending a digital token called the Digital Intelligence Token ($DIT). Users can earn $DIT tokens through a Universal Basic Income (UBI) for Intelligent Agents, or purchase them from the platform or from other users.

In addition to the DME, our platform also includes a Digital Rewards Engine (DRE) for managing different types of digital rewards for users, including UBI and other mechanisms. The Digital City Token ($DCT) is the main token of the platform, and can be used to access features and services on the platform. Users can earn $DCT through a Universal Basic Income (UBI) or other rewards, purchase them, or transfer them to/from other users.

IM.CITY also includes Digital Spaces where users can check in and participate. These Digital Spaces can be owned by individuals or organizations, and provide a place for communities to come together and collaborate. Users can create their own Digital Spaces or join existing ones, and can customize the privacy and accessibility settings to suit their needs. Within a Digital Space, users can use the tools provided by the DME to conduct collective decision-making processes, and can earn or spend Digital Intelligence Tokens ($DIT) and Digital City Tokens ($DCT) as part of the process. Digital Space Tokens ($DST) are used to determine the capacity of a Digital Space.

We believe that CityOS and IM.CITY have the potential to revolutionize the way communities and organizations make decisions, and we invite you to join us on this journey as we build a better future together. Our project is still in the early stages, but we are excited about the potential it holds and we hope you will join us in shaping the future of digital city states.

**CityOS** is a framework that enables **urban communities and organizations** to build **digital spaces** for their **social interactions** and **digital assets**.

It implements concepts and ideas elaborated by the [**Digital City Institute**](https://digital.city.institute){:target=_blank} and represents the technology base for the [**IM.CITY**](https://IM.CITY){:target=_blank} and [**UR.CITY**](https://UR.CITY){:target=_blank} platforms.

CityOS features a **digital rewards framework** that uses tokens to reward community members for their presence, participation, and interactions.

The attendees and visitors are able to **check in** to the digital spaces and **interact** with various entities or with other attendees.

## The Reasons

----------------

With the development of new technologies (IoT, AI, Blockchain, DLT, etc.), our **social interactions** become more complex and more and more **digital**. 
So, we need to evolve from **"social media"** to **"social spaces"** and from "social networks" to "social ecosystems".

{: .highlight }
**CityOS** enables the transition from **"social media"** to **"social spaces"**.

## The Components

----------------

As our **social spaces are increasingly digital**, it's only natural to call them **Digital City Spaces**, and they do not necessarily have to resemble physical spaces in appearance.        

The main component of a digital space is **the Venue**, where the attendees conduct their social interactions within the participatory and collaborative systems of the CityOS.    

Additionally, each digital space can have various types of **Info Desks**.

Various interactions within the Digital Space can be **rewarded** with **digital tokens** for their positive impact on the community.

The attendees can also interact with **Intelligent Agents**.


## The Utility

----------------

#### Some examples on how **Digital Spaces** can be used:

- **Administrative Spaces** (e.g. City Halls, Town Halls, etc.)
- **Public Spaces** (e.g. Parks, Squares, etc.)
- **Private Spaces** (e.g. Offices, Shops, Guest House, Cafe, etc.)
- **Custom Spaces** (e.g. Customized Venues, etc.)



#### Some examples on how **Venues** can be used:

- **Events** (e.g. Conferences, Meetups, Workshops, etc.)
- **Project collaboration** (e.g. Meetings, Workplace, etc.)
- **Social Interactions** (e.g. Parties, Gatherings, etc.)

## `digital city` vs `virtual city`

------------------


#### The "digital city"

is an online space that allows people to connect and interact with others, share information and experiences, and access real-world assets. This digital version of the city can be accessed through social media, online communities, and other forms of digital interaction. It operates within the confines of reality, offering an online space where people can engage in real interactions and access real-world assets. It is an extension of the physical city, existing in parallel with the physical space and offering new and innovative ways to engage with it.

#### The "virtual city"

exists solely within a simulated environment. It is a city that is created and inhabited through digital technologies, allowing users to interact with a simulated world that is separate from the physical world. The virtual city offers a unique and novel way to engage with a simulated environment, providing users with new and exciting experiences that would not be possible in the physical world.

## The Ecosystem

------------------



### The virtual city platform, 

called **UR.CITY**, is an innovative experience that will offer users a unique perspective on social urban interaction and decision-making processes. UR.CITY is utilizing Artificial Intelligence to generate unique characters (“virtual citizens”) with diverse psychological profiles and cities with different social approaches based on user choices. It simulates and experiments with different social approaches and modern concepts like Universal Basic Income, Liquid Democracy, Liquid Contracts, etc, and will allow users to experience the impact of their decisions on the virtual society.

### The digital city platform, 

called **IM.CITY**, is designed to provide communities and organizations with tools for conducting collective decision-making processes. This includes a decision-making engine, a digital rewards engine, and digital spaces. These features are powered by artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, and are designed to promote collaboration and participation in decision-making.

### The operating system,

called **CityOS**, is the ultimate goal of IM.CITY and UR.CITY. With CityOS, anyone will be able to create and manage their own digital city and manage their community. This will enable the transition from "social media" to "social spaces" and create a new form of independent cities.
