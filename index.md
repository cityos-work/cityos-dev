# Building Digital City Spaces

&nbsp;

## What is `CityOS`?

----------------

{: .highlight }
The **CityOS** is a framework that enables **urban communities and organizations** to build **digital spaces** for their **social interactions** and **digital assets**.

CityOS features a **digital rewards framework** that uses tokens to reward community members for their presence, participation, and interactions.

The attendees and visitors are able to **check in** to the digital spaces and **interact** with various entities or with other attendees.

## Components

----------------

Each digital space can have an **Info Desk**, an **Orders Desk**, and a **News Desk**.   
The main component of a digital space is **the Venue**, where the attendees conduct their social interactions within the participatory and collaborative systems of the CityOS.    

Within the Venue, the attendees can interact with the **Intelligent Agents** that are able to provide information, services, and products to the attendees.


## Utility
