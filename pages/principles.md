## Development Principles

----------------

### 1. Modular Architecture

The CityOS ecosystem is built on a modular architecture. This means that each layer of the ecosystem is built on a set of modules that can be used independently or together. This allows for the ecosystem to be easily extended and adapted to different use cases.


### 2. OS on Stop

If the development of the CityOS stops, the code will be open-sourced and handed to the community for further development.

### 3. PoC before MVP

The development of the CityOS ecosystem will start with a Proof of Concept (PoC) for each layer. The PoC will be used to validate the concept and the architecture of the ecosystem. The PoC will be developed in a way that will allow for a smooth transition to the MVP.

### 4. CRUD before DDD

This refers to the code pattern. We'll use the simpler create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) in the PoC stage and go for the domain-driven design (DDD) in the MVP stage.

### 5. ReMaSc

a) Release   
b) Manage   
c) Scale   

This means:

a) Make it work   
b) Only then, make it pretty (aka maintainable)   
c) Only then, make it scalable
