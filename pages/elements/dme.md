# Decision-Making Engine (DME)

----------------


The Decision-Making Engine (DME) is a participatory system that enables communities and organizations within Digital Cities (e.g. IM.CITY) to conduct collective decision-making processes within their groups. 

The DME can be activated for any Digital Space within IM.CITY, and provides a complete set of tools for research, dialogue, debate, and voting on various issues and topics. 

The DME also allows users to input data and offers the option to use "Intelligent Agents" (AI tools) to provide them with information or suggestions. 

The DME is designed to be easy to use and does not require a separate application to be downloaded. Users who own Intelligent Agents can use them by spending a certain type of token called "Digital Intelligent Agent Token" ($DIA). 

The goal of the DME is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of collective decision-making processes, and to provide a more inclusive and democratic platform for communities and organizations within Digital Cities (e.g. IM.CITY).
